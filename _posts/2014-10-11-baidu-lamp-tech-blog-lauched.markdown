Welcome here!

It is a [Baidu](http://baidu.com) semi-official LAMP stack related engineering blog, we will publish some notes and thoughs about LAMP stack technolgies here.

Topics include but not all: `Nginx`, `Linux`, `HHVM/PHP` and `web performance optimizations`.

Also we may opensource our internal projects to community.

Our Github address is <http://github.com/baidu-lamp>

Hold on tight.
